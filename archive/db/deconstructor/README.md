# archive/db/deconstructor/

## Purpose & Rationale
This directory preserves the early evolution of the compound deconstruction logic. Its rationale is to document the transition from rule-based Python scripts to the current high-performance Go-based architecture.

## Architectural Logic
Contains legacy sandhi splitting rules and experimental heuristics that informed the development of the modern deconstructor.

## Interface
Preserved for historical analysis of splitting logic.
