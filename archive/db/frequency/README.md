# archive/db/frequency/

## Purpose & Rationale
Stores legacy frequency calculation scripts used before the project standardized on the Go-based scanning engine. Its rationale is to preserve the original metrics and methods used to analyze Pāḷi corpora.

## Architectural Logic
Follows the project's early "Serial Corpus Processing" pattern in Python.
