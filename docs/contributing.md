# Contributing to Digital Pāḷi Dictionary

There are many ways to contribute to the project, but the two main areas that need attention are __Pāḷi__ and __coding__.

## Help with Pāḷi

The easiest way to help with Pāḷi is to:
1. Add any [missing words](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfResxEUiRCyFITWPkzoQ2HhHEvUS5fyg68Rl28hFH6vhHlaA/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1433863141=dpd-db) you come across. 
2. Correct any [__mistakes__](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9boBe7k5tCwq7LdWgBHHGIPVc4ROO5yjVDo1X5LDAxkmGWQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1433863141=dpd-db) that you see.
3. Add [__missing details__](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9boBe7k5tCwq7LdWgBHHGIPVc4ROO5yjVDo1X5LDAxkmGWQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1433863141=dpd-db) to dictionary entries.

The project uses Google Forms for these. The quickest way to access the forms is by opening the __feedback__ button.

If you would like to tackle something more substantial, please [get in touch by email](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com) and we can discuss some options for further involvement.

## Help with Coding

If you're a software developer and would like to contribute to the project, please get involved.

### DPD Project Management
Here's the [DPD Codebase](https://GitHub.com/orgs/digitalpalidictionary/projects/1/views/2) Project Management on GitHub with all the open and in-progress issues. Just comment on any issue to find out more, or [please get in touch by email](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com).

### DPD Project repo

Here's the [dpd-db](https://GitHub.com/digitalpalidictionary/dpd-db)  GitHub repo, which contains the code for all aspects of the project.

### Technical Docs
Here are the [technical docs](https://GitHub.com/digitalpalidictionary/dpd-db/blob/main/docs/build_db.md) in the dpd-db repo, for building the database, or just working with the pre-built database

### GitHub Releases
You can find the [latest releases](https://GitHub.com/digitalpalidictionary/dpd-db/releases) here on GitHub, which includes the latest version of the database. 

### Languages
DPD uses a few languages.

- __Python__: Most of the project backend is written in Python.   

- __HTML CSS JS__: All frontend is written in HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.  

- __Go__: A few of the more time-consuming operations, like the Deconstructor and generating Frequency tables, are written in Go to take advantage of its speed and concurrency.

- __Markdown__: This website and all the project docs are written in Markdown.  

### App Development
A long-term goal is to create a custom app for DPD and other Pāḷi Dictionaries. This would replicate the current lookup functionality of GoldenDict and further allow the integration of many requested features, which are not possible within the GoldenDict framework.
