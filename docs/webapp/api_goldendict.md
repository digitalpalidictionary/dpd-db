## Set up API in GoldenDict

Here's how to set up DPD as a live searchable website in GoldenDict. 

This has the advantage of being quite quick and easy to set up and always being up-to-date with the latest DPD database, and the disadvantage of being a second slower. 

⚠️ This will not work at the same time as the offline version of DPD, please disable it before continuing.

## Instructions

Open Menu > Edit > Dictionaries (Shortcut F3)
