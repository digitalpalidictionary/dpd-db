# Sutta Info

The Sutta tab provides detailed information about a discourse.

It handles one of the major problems with the different sets of Pāḷi texts, namely **differing numbering systems**. Using Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana numbering as a base, all other Pāḷi texts are aligned by the corresponding sutta, not by number (which can differ).
