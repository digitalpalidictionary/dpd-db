# Setup the Scan-pop

Scan popup works best on Linux. Mileage may vary on other operating systems. 

In GoldenDict, open Edit > Preferences (Shortcut F4)

![edit preferences](../pics/scan-popup/edit%20preferences.png)

Go to the Scan Popup tab and **enable scan popup functionality**. With these settings every word you click on will open in the dictionary

![scan popup tab](../pics/scan-popup/scan%20popup%20tab.png)

If that setting is a little extreme for you, try the setting in the pic below. 

![settings with scan flag](../pics/scan-popup/settings%20with%20scan%20flag.png)

Now, when you click a word in a Pāḷi text, a small dictionary icon will appear. Click it to open the word in the dictionary.

The settings I personally use are in the pic below. This opens the scan popup in the main window by pressing Alt-Shift.

Please experiment to find the settings that are comfortable for you.

Next, take a look at how to setup some [advanced features in GoldenDict](advanced.md).
