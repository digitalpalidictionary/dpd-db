## dpd_headwords table

### lemma_1

- Provide the dictionary form of the word.
- If the same word comes from different roots, use the numbering system (e.g., 1.1, 2.1, etc.).
- If words come from the same root but have different meanings, use the numbering system (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, etc.).
- If a word has clear different meanings in context, add a new number and meaning.
- If a word has different case relationships in different sentences (e.g., +acc in one, +dat in another), list the meanings separately.

### lemma_2

- Present clean Pāli without numbers.
- Neuter nouns that end in -a in Pali_1 will have -aṃ ending in Pali_2 (e.g., Pali_1: citta 1.1, Pali_2: cittaṃ).
- Masculine nouns that end in -a in Pali_1 will have -o ending in Pali_2 (e.g., Pali_1: dhamma 1.01, Pali_2: dhammo).

- For adj, avoid mentioning "pp of $derived_from," "prp of $derived_from," "ptp of $derived_from." However, it can be noted as "app of $derived_from."
- For idioms, mention the components from which it is composed (e.g., idiom, adv + ind + ind).
- For pr, specify if it is derived from a causative or passive form, e.g., "caus of $derived_from," "pass of $derived_from." 
- If a pr is formed from a passive base and then adds a causative suffix added, mention "pass of $derived_from," and in the field "verb" mention "caus"
- If a pr is formed from a causative base and then adds a passive suffix added, mention "caus of $derived_from," and in the field "verb" mention "pass"
