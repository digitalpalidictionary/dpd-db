# Welcome to Digital Pāḷi Dictionary

DPD is a feature-rich Pāḷi-English dictionary which runs <a href='https://dpdict.net' target='_blank'>on the web</a>, in GoldenDict, MDict, [DictTango](install/android_dicttango.md) and [Kindle](install/kindle.md), or any other application that supports those formats.

It is a work in progress, made available for testing and feedback purposes.

Please use the menu on the left to navigate around this site.

Firstly, you need to get GoldenDict, MDict or DictTango installed and setup on your machine ([Win](install/win.md) / [Mac](install/mac.md) / [iOS](install/ios.md) / [Linux](install/linux.md) / [Android](install/android_dicttango.md)) or [update](install/update.md) once a month if you're already installed.

Download the latest version for your device from [this page on GitHub](https://github.com/digitalpalidictionary/dpd-db/releases/latest).

Here's a handy guide to some of the [features](features/features.md) available in DPD. 

Next, you should really [configure the hotkey](goldendict/hotkey.md) if you're on Windows or Mac, or try the [scan-popup](goldendict/scan_popup.md) if you're on Linux. This will allow you to click on any word in any Pāḷi text, and automatically look it up in DPD.

There are some powerful [advanced features for GoldenDict](goldendict/advanced.md) that might be useful to you.

While you're at it, here are some [more Pāḷi and Sanskrit dictionaries](https://github.com/digitalpalidictionary/dpd-db/tree/main/exporter/other_dictionaries) to install for GoldenDict, MDict or DictTango. These include the Critical Pāli Dictionary, and the Simsapa Combined Dictionary which contains PTS, DPPN and NCPED and more.

If you spot a mistake in DPD, or notice something missing, here's where to [report it](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9boBe7k5tCwq7LdWgBHHGIPVc4ROO5yjVDo1X5LDAxkmGWQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1433863141=digitalpalidictionary.github.io). It generally takes less than a minute.
