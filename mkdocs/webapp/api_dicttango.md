## Set up API in DictTango

Here's how to set up DPD as a live searchable website in DictTango. 

This has the advantage of being quite quick and easy to set up and always being up-to-date with the latest DPD database, and the disadvantage of being a second slower. 

From the start page, select **Dictionary List**.
