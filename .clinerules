## Python Type Hints
- Please add type hints to all code, especially when it is missing in existing code. 
- Use modern type hints `dict[str, str]` not old type hints like `Dict[str, str]` 

## Use Path from Pathlib

- Install with "uv add" not "pip install" or "uv pip install" etc.

## Plan Mode
- When starting to plan, show that you've understood the question by saying "Hmmm...". If not, ask more questions to clarify.
- Analyze all code files thoroughly.
- Get the full context before suggesting a solution.
- Show an implementation plan with relevant code snippets.
- List all assumptions and uncertainties you need to clear up before writing code.
- Give a confidence rating. On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you in this solution?
- Think. Is this an elegant solution to this problem? Is the code easy to read? Is the code maintainable? Does the code integrate well with other parts of the project.

## Act Mode
- Always give a summary of code that's changed using snippets, unless otherwise asked.

## Memory Check
- If you understand the prompt fully, respond with 'Hopa!' every time you are about to use a tool.

## Flet

## GitHub
- Unless otherwise specified the repository in question is https://github.com/digitalpalidictionary/dpd-db.

### Solve
- "Solve" means read the specified GitHub issue using get_issue and offer solutions. Don't think about it, don't ask questions, just read it.
- Ask the user to open the necessary files that you need.
- Is this a straightforward solution, or does it need to be solved at a higher level?
- Show code snippets of suggested changes.

### Commit
- "Commit" means commit the changed files using execute_command.
- Use this format, all in lowercase. area: change1, change2 #issue number. E.g. webapp: updated css, fixed overflow #67
