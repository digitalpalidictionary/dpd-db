# Documentation Standards

## README Guidelines

We strive to maintain clear and consistent documentation across the project. Every directory (unless ignored) should contain a `README.md` file.

### Template

Please use the standard template located at `conductor/templates/DIR_README_TEMPLATE.md` when creating a new README.

### Sections

- **Purpose/Overview:** A concise summary of why the directory exists.
- **Key Components:** Important files or submodules within.
- **Relationships:** How this directory interacts with others (e.g., "Imports models from `db/`").
- **Usage/Commands:** CLI commands or scripts relevant to this folder.

### Tone

- Keep it technical but accessible.
- Explain "Why" something exists, not just "What" it is.
