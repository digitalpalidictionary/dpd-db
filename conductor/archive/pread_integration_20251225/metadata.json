  "description": "I want to create a button in gui2/pass2_add_view.py called 'PRead' which loads the results of the proofreader into the fields on the right hand side, as well as fetches the correct entry from the database. to achieve this, look at how gui2/additions_manager.py runs. it has a manager class to load, update and save the file. add something similar to tools/proofreader.py."
