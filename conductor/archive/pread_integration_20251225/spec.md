# Track: GUI2 Proofreader Integration ("PRead")

## Overview
Add a "PRead" button to `Pass2AddView` that allows lexicographers to quickly review and apply spelling/grammar corrections generated by the AI proofreader tool (`tools/proofreader.py`). The corrections are stored in `tools/proofreader.tsv`.

## Functional Requirements
1.  **ProofreaderManager:**
    *   Implement a `ProofreaderManager` class in `tools/proofreader.py`.
    *   Responsible for loading `tools/proofreader.tsv` (TSV format).
    *   Methods to `load`, `save`, and `get_next_correction` (which pops the first item and saves the TSV).
2.  **ToolKit Integration:**
    *   Instantiate `ProofreaderManager` in `gui2/toolkit.py`.
3.  **UI Components (`gui2/pass2_add_view.py`):**
    *   Add an `ElevatedButton` labeled "PRead" in the top section.
    *   Add a handler `_click_pread_button`.
4.  **Logic:**
    *   When "PRead" is clicked:
        1.  Fetch the next correction from `ProofreaderManager`.
        2.  If a correction exists:
            a.  Search for the word in the database using its `id`.
            b.  Load the database entry into the GUI (left-hand side).
            c.  Load the `meaning_1_corrected` value into the `meaning_1_add` field (right-hand side).
            d.  Update the UI message field with the remaining count of corrections.
        3.  If no corrections remain, notify the user.

## Non-Functional Requirements
*   Adhere to existing Flet/GUI patterns.
*   Ensure type hints are used throughout.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The "PRead" button appears correctly in the Pass 2 Add View.
*   Clicking "PRead" loads the correct headword and displays the suggested correction in the right-hand column.
*   The corresponding entry is removed from `tools/proofreader.tsv` immediately upon loading.
*   The "Remaining" count or a message is updated to reflect progress.

## Out of Scope
*   Automated applying of corrections without user review.
*   Modifying the AI proofreader logic itself (only the integration is in scope).
