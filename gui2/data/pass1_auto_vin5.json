He should assess himself, the others, the accuser, the accused, one who accuses illegitimately, one who is accused illegitimately, one who accuses legitimately, and one who is accused legitimately. Not omitting what has been said, nor announcing what has not been said, he should carefully scrutinize the sentences and words under consideration, question the others, and deal with them according to what they have admitted. He should gladden those who are confused, comfort those who are frightened, restrain those who are fierce, and expose those who are impure. Being upright and gentle, he should not be biased by favoritism, anger, confusion, or fear. He should be impartial in regard to the Teaching and the people involved. "
