        "comment": "[openrouter: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free] This is a compound word combining 'diṭṭhi' (view, belief) with 'viggaha' (analysis, resolution, dispute). Based on the grammatical context provided, this likely refers to the analytical breakdown or resolution of philosophical views, or possibly disputes arising from differing views. The fourth meaning of viggaha ('grammatical resolution of words into their elements') suggests this could be a technical term for analyzing philosophical concepts."

The sandhi implies either 'phassa eva pabhavo iti' (it is indeed the origin of sense contact) or 'phassassa pabhavo iti' (the origin of sense contact, thus).

The `vasa + ena` part means 'by means of' or 'in accordance with'.\n\nThe most challenging part is the initial element `to-`. In Pāḷi, `to` can be an ablative suffix (e.g., `sabbato`), but here it appears at the beginning of a compound, which is unusual. It is not a standard verbal prefix. It might be a rare particle, a pronominal element (like a variant of `ta` 'that'), or possibly even a textual anomaly, but without context, its precise function here is unclear. For this analysis, it is treated as an initial component of the compound `topaccayanta`.\n\n`paccaya` is a masculine noun meaning 'condition, cause, requisite, support'. It is derived from `pati + √i`.\n\n`anta` can be a masculine/neuter noun meaning 'end, boundary, part, side', or it can function as a suffix forming adjectives or participles (e.g., `gacchanta`). If `anta` acts as a suffix here, `paccayanta` would mean 'conditional' or 'pertaining to conditions'. If `anta` is the noun 'end', `paccayanta` could mean 'the end of conditions'. Given the adverbial nature, 'conditional' or 'pertaining to conditions' seems more likely for `paccayanta`.\n\nThus, `topaccayanta` likely refers to some 'conditional factor' or 'that which pertains to conditions', modified by the enigmatic `to-` element. The entire word then means 'by means of [these] conditional factors' or 'in accordance with [these] causal factors'."
