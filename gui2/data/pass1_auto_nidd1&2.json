        "comment": "[openrouter: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free] This is a compound word combining 'diṭṭhi' (view, belief) with 'viggaha' (analysis, resolution, dispute). Based on the grammatical context provided, this likely refers to the analytical breakdown or resolution of philosophical views, or possibly disputes arising from differing views. The fourth meaning of viggaha ('grammatical resolution of words into their elements') suggests this could be a technical term for analyzing philosophical concepts."
