The form `vīsatimaṭṭaṃ` with the `-ṃ` ending is likely used adverbially, meaning 'to the extent of twenty polished/smoothed items or actions'. However, based strictly on the provided dictionary entries for `maṭṭa` meaning 'smoothed; polished', this interpretation is grammatically derived but semantically unusual. External knowledge suggests that `maṭṭa` can sometimes be used for `matta` meaning 'measure, amount, only', in which case `vīsatimaṭṭaṃ` would mean 'amounting to twenty' or 'only twenty'. This latter meaning is far more common in Pāḷi texts, but cannot be derived solely from the dictionary entries provided here."
